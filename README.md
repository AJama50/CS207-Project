# Temperature Regulator [ v1.0 ]



My goal for this project is to build an arduino-controlled temperature regulator. A temperature regulator is a device that measures temperature change of a space, and achieves a desired average temperature by adjusting passage of heat energy into or out of the space. This type of technology is used in common household devices such as ovens, water heaters, and refrigerators, but they also have scientific and industrial applications. They are used to keep the temperature stable in a situation where something is to be heated, cooled, or both and to remain at the target temperature despite the constant temeprature change in the environment.

# Usage

This temperature regulator will be able to change the internal temperature of the plastic box by reading in, through the temperature sensor, the external temperature of the surrounding environment. The set temperature, current temperature, and whether the heater is on or off will be displayed using an LCD display. Pushbuttons will be used to turn on/off the heater, and also to adjust(up/down) the desired temperature. I might also use a potentiometer to adjust the temperature.
