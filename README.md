# Temperature Regulator [ v1.0 ]



My goal for this project is to build a temperature regulator. A temperature regulator is a device that measures temperature change of a space, and achieves a desired average temperature by adjusting passage of heat energy into or out of the space.

# Requirements and Materials

Bill of Materials (note: will be subject to change) :

* 1 x Arduino
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x Temperature Sensor (TMP36)
* 1 x LCD display
* 1 x Plastic Box 
* 1 x Aluminium foil
* 1 x Heating element/ Incandescent bulb/ Thermoelectric cooler
* 1 x Heat Sink
* 4 x Push buttons

# Build Instructions

# Usage

This temperature regulator will be able to change the internal temperature of the plastic box by reading in, through the temperature sensor, the external temperature of the surrounding environment. The set temperature, current temperature, and whether the heater is on or off will be displayed using an LCD display. Pushbuttons will be used to turn on/off, and adjust the desired the temperature.
